## PINs

**6-digit normal PIN** is the one you use on a day-to-day basis to use your GPG key to sign or encrypt. (Default: `123456`)

**8-digit admin PIN** is used for certain operations. It's important to change this because it is used to change the 6-digit normal PIN. (Default: `12345678`)

There is also a reset code. However, there are multiple ways to reset YubiKeys:

> If a wrong PIN has been entered three times in a row the card will be blocked. It can be unblocked with the AdminPIN.
>
> **Warning**
> It is also important to know that **entering a wrong AdminPIN three times in a row destroys(!) the card.** There is no way to unblock the card when a wrong AdminPIN has been entered three times.
